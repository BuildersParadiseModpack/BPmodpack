BPmodpack
=========

A public Modpack for the FTB launcher- Pack code: BPrules01

This is all open source as non of the mods included in the modpack were created by me (BeerCav) or anyone of the BPMP team. (soon to come hopefuly).

If you would like to become part of the BPMP team please message me at either

ATM I know very little about java but am working on it (specially since I'm the only one working on the pack lol)
I've asked a few people for help but with only one reply,...meh, I'll do it myself if I have to.
